# ReVanced marketing

To maintain a presence on the web, ReVanced has certain rules and conventions to market itself.

## Branding

ReVanced uses branding consistently according to the ReVanced branding guidelines. Whereever applicable, the ReVanced logo or name is used to present itself. Additionally ReVanced comes with a slogan as part of the branding guidelines whenever a description is needed.

## Representation

ReVanced is not represented by any individual. Instead, it is represented by itself. This means, that ReVanced speaks to the community and not e.g. the lead or team member. This can be observed in the ReVanced Discord server channel or the announcements page on the ReVanced Website for example. This ensures the community does not create a strong association between ReVanced and any individual and strengthens the bond between the community and ReVanced itself. However, the team is publicly presented by ReVanced, for example on the homepage, through Discord roles, donation pages, or in GitHub repository commits. Team members also interact directly with the community on an one-to-one basis <im auftrag von> ReVanced.

## Speech

As an open project, ReVanced uses neutral speech. This ensures the project remains true to its purpose and does not deviate into irrelevant matters. Neutral speech also ensures that no specific personality is embodied by ReVanced. While this may sound boring to some, it ensures ReVanced is not forced into some kind of appearance. Instead, it freely allows everyone to interpret ReVanced the way they see fit.
