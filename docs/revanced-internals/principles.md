# ReVanced principles

ReVanced is built on some principles and philosphy.

## Open and transparent

ReVanced believes in open and transparent communication. For this reason ReVanced is free and open-source and uses public platforms like GitHub, Reddit or Discord. Additionally, ReVanced minimizes reliance on proprietary tools or services if possible.

## Quality versus time

ReVanced values quality over time in most cases. If something can be better and the time investment is reasonable, ReVanced will prioritize improving the quality of the work over meeting tight deadlines.

## Decentralized

To reduce single point of failure and prevent hard dependency, ReVanced is designed to be as decentralized as possible. Code is open source and replicable, whereas extending systems like patches, downloader plugins and co. can be created and used by anyone out of ReVanced's scope.

## User-centric

The concept of ReVanced stems from a user-centric approach, allocating the task of using and applying the patches to the users themselves. This takes the burden of trust away from a centralized entity and places it in the hands of the users, allowing them to make informed decisions about their own experience. At the same time the legal implications and responsibilities are also transferred to the users, ensuring that they are fully aware of the actions they are taking. The community is encouraged to actively participate in ReVanced in many ways, including contributing to discussions, providing feedback, sharing their own experiences or directly contributing to the codebase. Maintainers engage with the community to accomplish this.

## Simplicity over complexity

ReVanced may look more complex than it actually is. Simplicity is favored in design and implementation, with the goal of making the codebase, the project and thus the user experience as straightforward as possible. Complex systems are often harder to understand and maintain, however ReVanced aims to be durable against the wear of time to sustain as much as possible in the future.

## Flat structure

ReVanced mostly favors a flat governance structure over a hierarchical one. All maintainers are equal contributors, and decisions are made collaboratively. This approach helps to prevent bottlenecks and monopolization by any single individual or group and encourages a diverse range of perspectives, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the project. Some hierarchy may exist for the sake of organization and efficiency, e.g. top level hierarchies like ReVanced Manager, ReVanced Patches, social media management or similar.

## Cost efficiency

ReVanced aims to achieve cost efficiency by self-hosting services, relying on free, free-tier or pro bono services. This allows ReVanced to be sustainable in the long run and allocate finances for more important initiatives and unavoidable costs like legal fees or domain registration. So far nearly net-zero costs have been achieved through these measures.

## Sustainability

ReVanced is committed to sustainability building upon its predecessor and sibling projects by being and using FOSS technologies, writing maintainable and simple code, documenting and communicating code & processes. This ensures that the project remains accessible and usable for future generations.

## Ownership

ReVanced is structured as an organization independent of any single individual. All accounts are created using ReVanced-controlled rather than personal emails, and no funds are held by or transferred to individuals. ReVanced is not represented by any individual, however authorized individuals may act or represent on behalf of the organization if necessary (e.g. legal matters). This principle also applies to leads. This approach ensures that the project does not rely on the availability or actions of any one person (e.g. if a lead abandons the project, it can continue with as minimal disruptions as possible).
