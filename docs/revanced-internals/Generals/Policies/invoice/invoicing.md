## 🧑‍🏭 Generating invoices

> **DANGER**
> If you don't have identification, toggle tax obligation off.
>
> **You are under the penalty of perjury if it's found out you actually have an government-issued identification.**

> **CAUTION**
> If you need the middle-man, be prepared to present identifications such as
> government-issued National ID card, passport, or any if requested by admin.

### Replacing the legal reference

> **DANGER**
> **This guide DOES NOT offer you free legal advises** nor liable for any damages.

To replace the legal reference in your invoice, scroll down to the amendment section,
toggle the acknowledgment check then proceed to enter your own legal statement.

Typically with your own law on 
***how will you be managing this income with the your country's tax agency, if you don't know consult with your tax advisor.***

### Generating invoices

1. Fill out your actual home address into form
2. Fill out your Tax ID (this usually refered to government-issued Tax ID or National ID, **please check with your country tax code** or else tick not eligble)
3. Select the services you provided, you can choose multiple services if applicable.
4. IF you are acting as a middle-man for someone else, follow these steps:
    1. In the "Payment Aggregation and Distribution" section, increase the number by 1 for each person you are representing. (0 = no middle-man)
    2. The total payout will increase as a multiple of your own payout and the amount of people you are middle-manning for. For instance, if your designated payout amount is 30€, and you're middle-manning for three people, your total payout will be increased by 30€ * 3, resulting in an additional 90€ added to your payout.
    3. Make sure that the person you're middle-maning to **had** the required identifications (e.g., National ID) as this will be in use later when requested by Open Collective administrators.
5. Enter your own payout amount, **make sure to be in sync with the rest of the team as all team members get equal amount.**
6. Submit the invoice then a PDF file will be downloaded.

## 🧾 Submitting invoices

> You must have an configured **Open Collective** account to submit the invoice.
> Please register or configure your account if you haven't, or let someone be the middle-man for you.

> **CAUTION**
> If you need the middle-man, be prepared to present identifications such as
> government-issued National ID card, passport, or any if requested by admin.
