# ReVanced finance

ReVanced receives financial contributions from the community in form of donations. These donations help support the ongoing development and maintenance of the project. The project is committed to transparency and accountability in its financial practices.

## Sources

The ReVanced website provides directions to various donation platforms:

- OpenCollective: This is the main platform for collecting donations and managing financial contributions to the ReVanced project. It is used to provide transparency regarding the project's finances and to allow contributors to see how their donations are being utilized.
- GitHub Sponsors: This platform allows users to financially support the ReVanced project directly through GitHub. However, those donations are sent to the OpenCollective account and are managed through that platform as well for transparency and accountability.
- Cryptocurrency: The ReVanced project also accepts donations in cryptocurrency, offering an alternative for contributors who prefer digital payments. As of now, the funds are managed separately and may not have the same level of transparency as other donation methods, transactions may still be traceable through public blockchain records. So far, these funds have mostly been untouched for further development.

## Treasury

Funds are held in a bank account under the ReVanced organization and a crypto wallet. Access to the treasury is granted to the single lead under the least privilege principle.

## Use

All funds are received by ReVanced, not individuals for profit. They are used to cover infrastructure or corporate expenses. Examples include paid external services like Google Cloud for Gemini (used in Crowdin), Domain name registration, virtual phone number, mailing or fax services, US registered agent and compliance filings to the state of incorporation or the government. Before the transition into a non-profit organization, remaining funds were shared evenly across all maintainers to support their work on the project. However, under a non-profit structure, maintainers are not paid as employees due to their nature of volunteer work, but as contractors under the respective agreements. Fair compensation for their work is ensured through law and these contracts.
