# ⚙️ ReVanced Internals

Documentation about ReVanced's internal structure and workings to learn more about how it operates.

## ❓ Why

ReVanced is a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project. However, one of the largest remaining gaps is transparency regarding its internal workings. By documenting its architecture and functionality, a clearer understanding of the project is established, making it easier for contributors to engage with and improve its internal workings.
